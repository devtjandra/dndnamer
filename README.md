# DnD Namer

Are you a Dungeons & Dragons DM? Are you sick and tired of your players asking you, "So what's his name?" and you don't have an answer? Well now you can whip one up in a jiffy!

DnD Namer is a little helpful tool to help randomise fantasy names, whether it's for your DnD NPCs or any other game where you're tired of spending hours (or at least 10+ minutes) coming up with the perfect name for your character.

## Getting a little more technical

This project is a Flutter app meant to learn Riverpod, an interesting library I want to try out.

## When will it finish?

Probably never.
